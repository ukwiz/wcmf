                <p><em>Bright and enjoyable performance for County Music Festival</em> </p>

<p>                    The Winchester County Music Festival has worked its usual miracle of drawing several choirs together from Twyford, Winchester, Botley and Itchen Valley, to produce a very clear and coherent performance. Haydn&rsquo;s Creation is a much-loved work, but one that makes substantial demands on both singers and orchestral forces.</p>
<p>                    Haydn came to oratorio later in life, but inspired by his visits to London, put the wealth of his composing experience into Creation. The vivid contrasts, the humour and the characterisation mark out his particular originality.
</p>
       <p>             The opening, with its contrast of the fragmented scoring of <em>Chaos</em> and then the explosion of
                    <em>Light</em> were both well caught by choir and orchestra.</p>
<p>                    <em>A New Created World</em> was beautifully balanced and <em>The Lord is Great</em> was especially effective; the soloists brilliant and accurate and the choir vigorous but clear.</p>
                    <p>The soloists and orchestra also caught the contrasts and characterisations well. The soprano, Cecilia Osmond, has a clear, bright timbre, and a defined enunciation that carry very well in the cathedral acoustic. Nicholas Mulroy (tenor) was a bright Uriel, declaiming <em>And God Saw the Light</em> with clarity and strength. Jamie Hall (bass/baritone) produced warm sounds in his baritone register, and partnered the other soloists very well, - especially in <em>By Thee With Bliss</em>.</p>
<p>                    The Winchester Festival Orchestra, led by Elizabeth Flower, deserves special mention as its clear, precise playing and grasp of dynamics combined sensitivity with accuracy. The directors of the choirs had clearly put much work into the training. Special credit must go to Derek Beck, who as well as conducting the performance, brought the choirs and orchestra together so well for the final rehearsals.
</p> <p>                   This was a very bright and enjoyable performance, and happily one that seemed to be enjoyed by the performers as much as by the audience.
</p>
