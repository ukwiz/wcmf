				<span class="title2">Sarisbury Choral Society</span></span><br>
<p class="text2">				Sarisbury Choral Society began life in 1948 as an evening class         funded by Hampshire County. As an evening class nobody was         barred from joining and the group were named &#147;The Sarisbury         Community Choir&#148;.         </p>
<p class="text2">The first conductor, Charles Martin, was appointed by County         Council in 1949 and he led the choir to compete in the         Winchester &amp; County Music Festival for the first time in 1951.         It was in 1960, after eleven years of hard work before the choir         won the Winchester Festival Banner. Charles Martin continued in         his post until his death in 1960 and he was succeeded by John Moody.         </p>
<p class="text2">In 1949 the Choir started an association with the Hamble Choir,         conducted by Mr Harding, the two choirs often singing in joint         concerts. The two choirs eventually amalgamated and became         Sarisbury &amp; Hamble Choral Society.         </p>
<p class="text2">John Moody retired in 1971 and handed the baton to Sheila Javes         who guided the choir to compete at both Winchester and         Petersfield Music Festivals.         </p>
<p class="text2">In 1985 Christine Stokes became conductor and the choir         continued to sing in Romsey Abbey and Winchester Cathedral.         </p>
<p class="text2">January 1996 saw Robin Phillips take over as Musical Director.         The choir reverted to Sarisbury Choral Society, reflecting the         catchment area of the choir members. It produces at least two         concerts a year, and also participates in Winchester &amp; County         Music Festival.         </p>
<p class="text2">Since 2000 we have supported Voices for Hospices and biannually         host &#147;Come &amp; Sing&#148; performances with friends from other choirs         in the area who love to sing. Our chosen hospice for support         from these concerts is &#147;Naomi House&#148;.         </p>
<p class="text2">In 2009, Graham Kidd became our Musical Director.         </p>
<p class="text2">Members of the choir take part in various &quot;Come and Sing&quot; events         held in the Royal Albert Hall, London, including the annual         Messiah Concert conducted by Sir David Willcocks.         </p>
<p class="text2">Our existence of over 60 years is due entirely to our love of         singing and also to the support from the talented conductors and         accompanists, who have given us so much encouragement.</p>
