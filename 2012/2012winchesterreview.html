                <p><strong>French Choral Music</strong> </p>

<p>Now in its ninth decade, this joyous celebration of choral singing brought an ambitious programme of 19th and 20th century French choral works to Winchester Cathedral.  It featured the joint choirs of Compton and Shawford, Overton, Twyford and Winchester under the inspired direction of Derek Beck.
 </p><p>
    Bizet&rsquo;s <em>Te Deum</em> and Gounod&rsquo;s <em>St. Cecilia Mass</em> are unjustly neglected works and they offered the chorus the opportunity for singing that was both rousing and meditative.  The three soloists blended well in the <em>Crucifixus</em> section of the Gounod <em>Mass</em>.  Bass Michael Bundy displayed a full and rounded tone and tenor Edward Goater produced a bright, incisive sound.  Soprano Anna Dennis caught the gentle mood of the <em>Benedictus</em> most beautifully.  The orchestra had its moments of glory too and there were several passages of excellent solo work from various players.
                </p><p>
    Poulenc&rsquo;s <em>Gloria</em>, written in the late 1950s, presents a challenge with its rhythmic and harmonic complexities and this came across well despite the blurring of the detail in the acoustic.  The chorus captured the vitality of the piece and the orchestra delivered the jazz-inflected rhythms with gusto.  Anna Dennis gave a meltingly beautiful rendition of the solo part; it felt as though this music could have been written for her voice and she conveyed a commanding presence as her brilliant top notes penetrated down the nave.
                </p><p>
    The final rousing chorus of the Gounod <em>Mass</em> had its patriotic words about the French Republic amended to celebrate this Royal Jubilee year.  With its military band-style orchestration it made a fitting conclusion to a fine concert.  It is so good to see the amateur choral music scene thriving in Hampshire.
