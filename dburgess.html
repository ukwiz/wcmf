				<h3>David Burgess - WCMF Conductor</h3>
<div class="text2">
    <p>David Burgess was appointed Musical Director of <a href="botley.html"><span class="hyperlink">Botley Choral Society</span></a> in September 1990 and has led the choir in numerous successful performances.  He conducts the Romsey Abbey concert in the Winchester and County Music Festival every other year and tries to include in each programme a piece that has not been previously performed in the Festival.  Such works include Malcolm Archer&rsquo;s <em>Requiem</em>, Pergolesi&rsquo;s <em>Stabat Mater</em> in its SATB version, Karl Jenkins&rsquo; <em>Stabat Mater</em>, and, in 2014, Bob Chilcott&rsquo;s <em>Requiem</em>.  </p>
   <p> David was born, educated and trained in Hampshire, and was one of the early recipients of a County Music Exhibition. He read music and education at King Alfred&rsquo;s College, Winchester, and studied the organ with Christopher Gower and David Thorne at Portsmouth Cathedral. David holds Diplomas in piano performing, teaching and accompaniment and as an accompanist gave recitals throughout Hampshire and the Isle of Wight with a locally known soprano, performing many of the Poulenc Melodies. </p>
<p>    David is Director of Music at All Saints Church, Botley, where he has established a monthly programme of musical events as well as being Musical Director of the bi-annual Botley Music Festival. He also serves as Deputy Church Warden, and is an active member of the Royal School of Church Music in the Portsmouth Area. </p>
 <p>   David is a member of the Society of Recorder Players and has conducted the Wessex Branch as well as directing a playing session in the National Festival at Guildford in April last year.  He has been guest conductor at the London, South London and Dorset Branches.  David directs the Upham Recorder Orchestra, affectionately known as &lsquo;URO&rsquo;.  This is a community venture which provides an opportunity for adults and children to make music together.</p>
<p>    Music is an all-embracing work and leisure pursuit, but David becomes restless if too many evening pass without a game of Canasta and a glass of wine. </p></div>
