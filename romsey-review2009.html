			<span class="text"><a href="romsey.html"><span class="hyperlink">Romsey Abbey</span></a> - 16th May 2009 - Review<br></span>
				<span class="text2">Conductor: <a href="jsutton.html"><span class="hyperlink">John Sutton</span></a></span><br><br>
					<span class="text2">Romsey Abbey was the perfect setting for this year’s annual concert as part of the Winchester and County Music Festival in association with Music in Romsey. The Festival, now in its 88th season, provides an opportunity for small local choirs to combine and perform larger scale choral works than they could undertake alone. This year The Abbey played host to Compton & Shawford Festival Choir, Itchen Valley Choral Society and Winchester City Festival Choir. This resulted in some 150 voices in a performance of Handel’s Sacred Oratorio ‘Judas Maccabaeus’, together with a team of soloists and a Festival Orchestra conducted by John Sutton.  <br><br>
Handel’s Sacred Drama, composed in 1746 and first performed in 1747, tells the story of the attempts of Judas Maccabaeus, a famous Jewish leader to fight off oppressive armies and re-establish religious freedom for the Jews. Handel’s librettist captured the contemporary national mood of triumph and rejoicing in the wake of the victorious outcome of the Duke of Cumberland’s Scottish campaign in 1746. The three part Oratorio reflecting initial mourning, calls to Arms and eventual victory, was effectively conveyed by the combined choirs. They responded enthusiastically to the well prepared and meticulous direction of John Sutton, whose generally steady speeds enabled the wide ranging emotional feelings of the Israelites to be fully transmitted to the appreciative Abbey audience.<br><br>
The experienced team of soloists all fulfilled their roles with musical sensitivity and expressiveness throughout the performance. Paul Badley, in the heroic role of Judas Maccabaeus, was particularly declamatory in the well known aria ‘Sound an Alarm’ where his tenor voice, aided by some fine instrumental accompaniment, fully exploited the resonant acoustic of The Abbey. Likewise, Michael Bundy, as Simon, brother to Judas whose sonorous and firm bass voice made an impressive impact in his first aria, ‘Arm, arm ye brave!’ Significantly there is an absence of ‘character roles’ for the two female soloists who sing simply as ‘Israelitish woman’ and ‘Israelitish man’. However Handel has perhaps written some of his finest music for their contribution. This was notably evident in the duet ‘Come, ever-smiling beauty’ from Act 1 when Jennifer Shell, soprano and Janet Shell, mezzo-soprano, sang with stylish beauty and exquisite tenderness. Indeed Janet Shell’s clearly focussed voice combined with expressive tone in her aria, ‘Father of Heav’n’ was perhaps a notable highlight from Act 3 together with another duet for the two female soloists singing as part of the famous penultimate chorus ‘See, the conquering hero comes’. The chamber sized orchestra of professional and amateur players played meticulously throughout and never dominated either soloists or chorus.<br><br>
The final chorus, ‘Hallelelujah! Amen’, brought this most enjoyable concert to a jubilant and fitting conclusion.<br><br>
